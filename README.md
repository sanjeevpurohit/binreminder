## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the bin-reminder-app folder
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build

# For Vercel deployment (optimized)
npm run build:vercel
```

## üöÄ Deploying to Vercel

### Prerequisites for Deployment

1. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Git Repository**: Code should be in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
3. **CSV Data**: Ensure `enhanced_postcode_bin_collection_schedule.csv` is in the `public/` folder

### Method 1: Automated Deployment Script

```bash
# Make sure you're in the bin-reminder-app directory
cd bin-reminder-app

# Run the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Install Vercel CLI if needed
- ‚úÖ Verify CSV data file exists
- ‚úÖ Test build locally
- ‚úÖ Deploy to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Provide deployment URL

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy the app**:
   ```bash
   # Preview deployment
   vercel

   # Production deployment
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Method 3: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push to Git repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect repository to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect React app and deploy

### Deployment Configuration

The app includes these Vercel-specific files:

- **`vercel.json`**: Deployment configuration with CSV serving
- **`.vercelignore`**: Files to exclude from deployment
- **`deploy.sh`**: Automated deployment script

### Environment Variables

For production deployment, you can set these environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

```
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:

1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click "Domains" tab
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS settings as instructed

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, test these features:

1. **App loads correctly** at the Vercel URL
2. **CSV data loads** (search functionality works)
3. **Sample postcodes work**: SW1A 1AA, B3 6NA, LE2 8IQ
4. **Responsive design** on mobile/tablet
5. **Council links** redirect to official websites

### Updating the Deployed App

To update the live app:

```bash
# Make your changes
# Run the deployment script again
./deploy.sh

# Or manually
vercel --prod
```

### Troubleshooting Deployment

**CSV file not loading**:
- Ensure file is in `public/` directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify file name matches exactly

**Build failures**:
- Run `npm run build:vercel` locally first
- Check for any TypeScript/ESLint errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

**404 errors**:
- Check `vercel.json` routing configuration
- Ensure SPA routing is properly configured
