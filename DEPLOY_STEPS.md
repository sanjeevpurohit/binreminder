# ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Vercel Deployment Guide

Since the automated script requires interactive login, here are the exact manual steps:

## 1. Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Choose your preferred login method:
- **GitHub** (recommended if you have a GitHub account)
- **GitLab** 
- **Email**
- **Other options**

Follow the browser authentication process.

## 2. Deploy the App

After successful login, run:

```bash
# For production deployment
vercel --prod

# OR for preview deployment first
vercel
```

## 3. Follow the Prompts

Vercel will ask:

1. **"Set up and deploy"** â†’ Press **Enter** (Yes)
2. **"Which scope"** â†’ Choose your account
3. **"Link to existing project"** â†’ **N** (No, create new)
4. **"What's your project's name"** â†’ **bin-reminder-app** (or custom name)
5. **"In which directory"** â†’ Press **Enter** (current directory)
6. **"Want to override settings"** â†’ **N** (No, use defaults)

## 4. Wait for Deployment

Vercel will:
- âœ… Upload your files
- âœ… Build your React app
- âœ… Deploy to global CDN
- âœ… Provide your live URL

## 5. Your Live App

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://bin-reminder-app-xyz123.vercel.app
```

## 6. Test Your Deployment

Visit your URL and test:
- âœ… App loads correctly
- âœ… Search works with: **SW1A 1AA**, **B3 6NA**, **LE2 8IQ**
- âœ… CSV data loads (search functionality works)
- âœ… Responsive design on mobile

## ðŸ”„ Future Updates

To update your live app:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Vercel remembers your settings, so subsequent deployments are one command!

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Git-Based Deployment

If you prefer Git-based deployment:

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel auto-detects and deploys

This method auto-deploys on every Git push!
